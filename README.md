Set up instructions:
The gitlab assignment 2 repository must be cloned into your assign02 folder in pico-apps. Delete the assign02.c and assign02.s in the assign02 folder, the only
thing in this folder should be the microprocessorsgroup28 folder and the CMakeLists.txt. Edit the CMakeLists.txt file in the assign02 folder and type 
"add_subdirectory(microprocessorsgroup28)" into it. There should now be no errors in any of the files.
